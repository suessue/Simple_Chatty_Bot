# Simple_Chatty_Bot
TagarelaBot - JetBrains Academy

Program made using basic syntax of Java: variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
The bot has a portuguese name, but speaks Spanish.
Over 50 Java problems from the platform are also posted - simple and complex ones. 
I added features to some exercises, for example, in the Collatz Conjecture problem, I also output the number of steps taken to reach 1, besides indicating the sequence of integers.
